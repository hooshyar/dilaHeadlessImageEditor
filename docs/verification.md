# Dila Headless Image Editor - Verification Report

## Verification Steps Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Verification
- Confirmed that the project structure has been reorganized as planned
- Verified that all directories (`app/`, `docs/`, `fonts/`, `output/`, `tools/`) exist and contain the expected files

### 2. File Removal Verification
- Confirmed that redundant files (`font_utils.py`, `app.py`, `test_api.py`) have been removed from the root directory
- Verified that `test_api.py` was successfully moved to the `tools/diagnostics` directory

### 3. Symbolic Link Verification
- Confirmed that the symbolic link for `process_local.py` was created correctly
- Verified that the symbolic link points to `tools/scripts/process_local.py`

### 4. Output Directory Verification
- Confirmed that the output directories (`output/images/` and `output/temp/`) were created successfully
- Verified that the application creates these directories on startup if they don't exist

### 5. Code Functionality Verification
- Fixed import path handling in `process_local.py` to support symbolic link execution
- Verified that the `process_local.py` script works correctly when executed through the symbolic link
- Successfully processed a test image using the script

### 6. Application Startup Verification
- Confirmed that the application starts correctly with the command `python -m run --port 5003 --debug`
- Verified that the API health check endpoint (`/api/health`) returns a successful response

### 7. Documentation Updates
- Updated `changes.log` to document all changes made
- Updated `tasks.md` to reflect completed tasks and add new tasks
- Created `context.md` to document the project's purpose and structure

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Import Path Issue**: The `process_local.py` script had an issue with imports when executed through a symbolic link. This was fixed by using `os.path.realpath(__file__)` to determine the actual script location.

2. **Missing Dependencies**: The application required additional dependencies (`APScheduler`, `python-dotenv`, `gunicorn`) which were installed.

3. **Port Conflict**: The default port (5001) was already in use, so we tested with an alternative port (5003).

## Conclusion

The Dila Headless Image Editor has been successfully restructured and verified. The application now has a more organized directory structure, improved documentation, and better code organization. All core functionality has been tested and confirmed to be working correctly.
